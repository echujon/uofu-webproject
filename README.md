This is a Flask (Python) Project that uses D3.js for the visualizations. 
I set up a virtual enviroment (.venv) that is running Flask.
Set up steps for this can be found here: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/
The D3.js library will be delivered by the CDN jsdelvir.net.

The main backend code is found in app.py, all the APIs can be found there. 

The static directory contains all the javascript and css files that we need for this project.
I've added the JSON file soccer_small.json needed to extract data that's needed.

The Graph and Visulization will be shown on the home (/) page:
